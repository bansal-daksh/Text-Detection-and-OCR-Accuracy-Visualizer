# Text-Detection-and-OCR-Accuracy-Visualizer

A Python project that leverages EasyOCR and OpenCV to extract, visualize, and validate text detected in images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The tool compares OCR output to a predefined sentence and highlights matches and mismatches with intuitive visuals.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Text Detection:** Uses EasyOCR to detect text in images.
- 🖼️ **Bounding Box Visualization:** Highlights detected text regions on the image using OpenCV and Matplotlib.
- 📊 **Letter-by-Letter Comparison:** Compares OCR output with a given expected sentence.
- ✅ **Match Analysis:** Displays results in both a color-coded table and a styled console output.
- 📥 **Easy Image Upload (Colab-friendly):** Allows uploading images interactively in Google Colab.
